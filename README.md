# AI.3 Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project
**Medical Robotics Project 2025**

## Dataset Examples

1. **[Breast Cancer MSI Multimodal Image Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zoya77/breast-cancer-msi-multimodal-image-dataset)**  
   This dataset contains multimodal breast cancer images, including histopathology and molecular subtypes, suitable for segmentation and classification tasks. It is curated for research in breast cancer diagnosis using AI-based image analysis.

2. **[Duke Breast Cancer MRI Dataset (TCIA)](http://cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/duke-breast-cancer-mri/)**  
   This collection includes breast MRI scans from patients with confirmed breast cancer. The dataset provides annotated images suitable for segmentation, detection, and treatment planning research.

3. **[CBIS-DDSM: Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (TCIA)](http://cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/cbis-ddsm/)**  
   The CBIS-DDSM dataset contains mammography images with verified breast cancer cases and corresponding lesion annotations. It is widely used for developing and benchmarking breast cancer detection and segmentation algorithms.
